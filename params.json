{"name":"TC-LOGO","tagline":"Trivial C Logo Compiler","body":"# TC-LOGO\r\nThis is a school project done in INSA Lyon. The main goal is to implement a simple LOGO compilator to SVG format.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\nThe compiler uses flex and bison to parse and interprets the code. It represents it in a C struct to be able to easily \r\nnavigate in the program. After representation, the compiler writes the SVG on the output.\r\n\r\n### What can it do ?\r\n- Simple instructions like FORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT or REPEAT\r\n- Manage the pen by PU (pen up) and PD (pen down)\r\n\r\n### It can be better\r\n- Implements macro for circle and square\r\n- Optimize SVG output\r\n\r\n## Licencing stuff\r\n[![GNU GPL v3.0](http://www.gnu.org/graphics/gplv3-127x51.png)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\r\n\r\n&copy; 2015 Philippe VIENNE\r\n\r\n### Notice if you are in INSA Lyon - TC departement\r\nMy work is under GNU GPL V3. So if you are currently in TC, you can use it but you have to write down that the code comes\r\nfrom Philippe VIENNE ; teachers will surely not agree.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
